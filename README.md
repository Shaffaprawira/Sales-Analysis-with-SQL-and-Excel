# Sales Performance Project

## Project Background

This project analyzes the sales performance of a fictional BikeStore business, using real-world-inspired data from a sample SQL database. The goal is to assess the company's revenue trends, customer behavior, and store performance over time. This end-to-end analysis, conducted using SQL and Microsoft Excel, provides insights into sales across various dimensions, including products, stores, and customers.

The project simulates a real-world business scenario where a data analyst works to identify opportunities for growth and improve operational efficiency by examining historical data.

## Data Source

- **Dataset**: The dataset used is the [BikeStores Sample Database](https://www.sqlservertutorial.net/getting-started/sql-server-sample-database/), which includes two schemas: `sales` and `production`. These schemas contain nine interrelated tables that represent business operations, including customer orders, staff, product inventory, and store data.

  **Schemas:**

  - **Sales Schema**: Contains information about customer orders, staff, stores, and order details.
  - **Production Schema**: Includes information about products, categories, brands, and stock levels.

- **North Star Metrics**:

  - **Total Revenue**: The primary metric measuring business success, derived from the sum of sales across different stores and products.
  - **Total Units Sold**: The number of products sold, providing a direct measure of product demand.

- **Dimensions**:
  - **Time** (Year, Month): Revenue trends over time.
  - **Location** (State, Store): Geographical performance by state and store.
  - **Product Category**: Sales by different product categories (e.g., Mountain Bikes, Road Bikes).
  - **Customer**: Insights into top customers by revenue.

## Insights Deep Dive

- **Revenue Trends by Year**: Revenue in 2017 saw a substantial increase compared to 2016, but dropped again in 2018. Analyzing monthly performance, the peak sales occurred around April 2018, followed by fluctuations.
- **Revenue by State**: New York leads with the highest sales, followed by California and Texas. This suggests that marketing efforts and sales strategies in New York have been particularly effective.

- **Store Performance**: Among the stores, Baldwin Bikes dominates the sales, contributing 68% of total revenue. Santa Cruz Bikes and Rowlett Bikes trail behind, showing room for improvement in these locations.

- **Product Category Breakdown**: Mountain Bikes were the top-selling category, generating over Rp3 million in revenue. Road Bikes and Cruiser Bikes followed, each bringing in over Rp1 million. This highlights the strong market demand for these product types.

- **Top 10 Customers**: Pamela Newman is the top customer, with nearly Rp38,000 in purchases. Other high-value customers include Abby Gamble and Sharyn Hopkins, emphasizing the importance of retaining these key customers.

## Recommendations

1. **Expand Marketing in Underperforming States**: States like Texas and California, while still profitable, have room for growth. Expanding targeted marketing campaigns in these regions could drive higher revenue.

2. **Diversify Product Offerings in Low-Performing Categories**: Categories like Children Bicycles and Comfort Bicycles generated the least revenue. Consider expanding product lines or promoting these categories to boost sales.

3. **Store-Level Optimization**: While Baldwin Bikes is performing well, stores like Santa Cruz Bikes and Rowlett Bikes need more attention. Revamping the product assortment or introducing localized promotions could improve their sales.

4. **Customer Retention Programs**: High-value customers like Pamela Newman and Abby Gamble should be the focus of loyalty programs or personalized offers to ensure continued business and increase lifetime customer value.

## Assumptions and Caveats

- **Data Completeness**: The dataset covers three years (2016-2018). While this offers valuable trends, the results might not reflect the business's long-term performance.
- **Seasonality**: The analysis assumes no significant seasonal effects. However, real-world sales might exhibit seasonal spikes, especially for products like bikes.
- **Exclusion of Costs**: This analysis focuses solely on revenue without factoring in the costs associated with production, shipping, or marketing. Future work could include profitability analysis for a more complete business assessment.
- **Sampling Bias**: This is a sample dataset, and while it simulates a real-world scenario, actual business dynamics could introduce additional complexities.
